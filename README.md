Go Patients is a web application designed to streamline intra-hospital patient transfers between medical staff and porters at the Hospital de Fuenlabrada and the Centro de Especialidades El Arroyo. Developed with Vue.js and Firebase, the platform allows doctors to request transfers, porters to receive real-time notifications and manage tasks, and supervisors to monitor and organize transfer workflows. The system includes role-based authentication, dynamic forms, visual priority indicators, and a queue-based algorithm for fair task assignment. While integration with the hospital's HIS (Selene) is envisioned, it is not part of the current implementation.
